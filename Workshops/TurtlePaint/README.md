## Step 1: Diagramming the project with Figma  

I opted to start with my Screen Structure (excluding the if save, for now)

Then began planning my Class Structure (this is before adding paint() to its' own interface)

## Step 2: Coding my turtle application

I started with my abstract Shape Class which would act as a Parent Class to Circle, Square and Rectangle.

Then I added each of my Shapes

Next, it was time to set up the MainApp Class

Featuring a whole lot of class variables

At this point I decided to create a new method for turning my user's color choice (String) into and actual Color data type.

Now to create an interface for that paint() method

## Step 3: Running the App  

Let's launch this app and see what happens!

It works! But now we need to let our users save their masterpieces!

## Step 4: Relief!

Super proud of this project and had a blast creating it :)
